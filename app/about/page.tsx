        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
  Hi! I'm <strong>Asmita Mandal</strong>, a passionate and curious Computer Science undergraduate currently in my 3rd year. I specialize in machine learning, data analytics, and web development, with hands-on experience in building real-time applications that blend AI with impactful user experiences.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-4">
  My technical toolkit includes <strong>Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, DeepFace</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, along with skills in <strong>data mining</strong> and <strong>API integration</strong>. Whether it's developing AI/ML models, creating interactive dashboards, or deploying end-to-end applications, I love turning data-driven ideas into practical, user-friendly solutions.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-4">
  Alongside coding, I bring a creative spark to everything I doâ€”be it leading university tech events, dancing as a lead in University's society, or collaborating on cross-functional projects. I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity, always aiming to build technology that not only works but connects.
</p>
<p className="text-lg">
  I'm always looking to learn, explore, and contribute to future-forward teams and meaningful projects.
