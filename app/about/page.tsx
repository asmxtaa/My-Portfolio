        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
  Hi, I’m <strong>Asmita Mandal</strong>, a final-year Computer Science student at KIIT with a strong passion for combining technology, strategy, and creativity. I enjoy solving real-world problems through backend development, data analysis, and machine learning.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-4">
  I’ve worked on projects like <strong>BeatsFinds</strong>—a song identification web app, and data visualization dashboards using Power BI. I've also explored <strong>AI-powered video summarization</strong> workflows and backend integrations with platforms like Nhost and n8n.
</p>
<p className="text-lg mb-4">
  Beyond academics, I actively lead and contribute to cultural and technical initiatives as the <strong>Assistant Coordinator</strong> of my department’s dance society and as part of the organizing team for university tech fests. These experiences help me blend <strong>communication, leadership, and innovation</strong>.
</p>
<p className="text-lg">
  I'm a quick learner, collaborative by nature, and driven to grow in roles across <strong>software development, QA analysis, and business development</strong>. Let’s build something impactful together!
</p>
